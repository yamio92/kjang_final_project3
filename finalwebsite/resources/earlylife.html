    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Early</strong> life was simple in those days. We lived in a humble mansion by the woods. There werent
        any other kids around and my brother was
        to young to play with so I was on my own a lot. I didn't mind. I would spend a lot of time playing in the
        woods and thats how I met my animal friends. We would use trees with spaces inside as our meet up and hang
        out spots. I befriendd a pack of wolves and they accepted me as one of
        their own. They would let me run around with them when they were in my area and let me play fight with them.
    </p>
    <p><strong>As</strong> long as you show respect to
        the pack everything works out just fine. Running around with these wolves also helped me meet my bear
        friend. He was a good bear that was trained by the circus and managed to escape from the harsh treatment to
        save his life. It was brutal but because of this he was
        highly skilled at doing tasks and would show them to me. We
        often took photos together of him pretending to do human things like greet costomers and give high fives.
        I was never scared of being int the forest when I was around my animal friends. You would not believe the
        views you see, they seem almost magical.

        <h3>Bears in the Circus</h3>
        <img src="bear.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Bears use to be big acts in circuses. They would have them do tricks and ride around on byclycles. It might
            sound cute but the way they trained them was extremely cruel. They would abuse and hit the bears ,often time
            cubs taken from mothers, or chain them b ut so they has no where to go. Some circus acts still use live
            animals and it has got to stop. Dont support any acts that use live animals. They belong in the wild roaming
            free.

            <h3>The Wolves</h3>
            <img src="wolfpic3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                wolves live in families called packs. Very similar to some human families, a father, a mother, and some
                pups. They are very group oriented and do most thinks as a pack so every member is a valuable creature.
                The alpha male and female are the ones in charge in the heiarchy system. The rule is only the alpha
                males get to reproduce and they also get to eat first.
